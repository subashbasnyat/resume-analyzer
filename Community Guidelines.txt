Community and behavioral expectations:
1. Never commit or push without notifying project members.
2. It is suggested to note down pull and commit procedures in a notecopy for easier recall.
3. Do not upload unsure/incomplete code in Github. 
4. Test the performance of code primarily in your machine and only then create a pull request.
